# The rulez

There's a couple. They're not even really rules, more just telling you what you
can expect.

* Issues are ALWAYS welcome, whether or not you think it's a dumb question or
  it's been asked before. I make a very real attempt to respond to all issues in
  24 hours. You can email me directly if I don't make this deadline.

* Pull requests for small bug fixes have the same rules as issues, just submit
  it and I'll get to it ASAP.

* I'm very hesitant to change the actual API in any way normally. But I also
  don't like telling people to throw away work they've already done. So please,
  before you go adding a new feature and submitting a PR, please submit an issue
  so we can possibly save you some work.

* The API never breaks. All PRs which aren't backwards compatible will not be
  accepted. Similarly, if I do commit something which isn't backwards compatible
  with an older behavior please submit an issue ASAP so I can fix it.
